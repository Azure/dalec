This patch contains all the patches specified in a Dalec (https://github.com/Azure/dalec) spec.
Patches in Dalec are not compatible with Debian's source package layout as they are applied directly to the source directory.
As such, a single patch file is generated after applying all patches to the source directories.

To review patches separately, see the debian/dalec/patches/<source name> directory or
see the patch script in debian/dalec/patch.sh
