# Dalec

Dalec is a project aimed at providing a declarative format for building system packages and containers from those packages.

Our goal is to provide a secure and reproducible way to build packages and containers, with a focus on supply chain security.

> [!NOTE]
> Dalec is still under heavy development and the spec format is not currently considered stable. Feedback is welcome! ❤️
