# Dalec

## What is Dalec?

Dalec is a [Docker Buildkit frontend](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/frontend/) that translates declarative YAML specifications into build instructions. Think of it as a specialized compiler that takes your package configuration and produces packages and containers across multiple Linux distributions and Windows.

## Why Use Dalec?

- **Unified Build Process**: Write once, build for multiple targets (Debian, Ubuntu, Azure Linux, Rocky Linux, etc.)
- **Supply Chain Security**: Built-in support for SBOMs, provenance attestations, and package signing
- **Docker-Native**: Leverages Docker Buildkit's caching, parallelization, and security features
- **Cross-Platform**: Build packages for different architectures and operating systems

## Features

- üê≥ No additional tools are needed except for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)!
- üöÄ Easy to use declarative configuration
- üì¶ Build packages and/or containers for a number of different [targets](https://azure.github.io/dalec/targets)
  - DEB-based: Debian, and Ubuntu
  - RPM-based: Azure Linux, Rocky Linux, and Alma Linux
  - Windows containers (cross compilation only)
- üîå Pluggable support for other operating systems
- ü§è Minimal image size, resulting in less vulnerabilities and smaller attack surface
- ü™ü Support for Windows containers
- ‚úçÔ∏è Support for signed packages
- üîê Ensure supply chain security with build time SBOMs, and Provenance attestations
