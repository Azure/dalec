Dalec is a project aimed at providing a declarative format for building system packages and containers from those packages.

Our goal is to provide a secure and reproducible way to build packages and containers, with a focus on supply chain security.

## Features

- 🐳 No additional tools are needed except for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)!
- 🚀 Easy to use declarative configuration that provides reproducible builds
- 📦 Build packages and/or containers for [Azure Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/azurelinux) 2 and 3 (formerly known as CBL-Mariner)
- 🔌 Pluggable support for other operating systems
- 🤏 Minimal image size, resulting in less vulnerabilities and smaller attack surface
- 🪟 Support for Windows containers
- ✍️ Support for signed packages
- 🔐 Ensure supply chain security with build time SBOMs, and Provenance attestations

👉 To get started with building packages and containers, please see [Building with Dalec](build.md)!
