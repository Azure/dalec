title: Building from source
---

In this section, we'll go over how to build packages from source with Dalec.

To do this, we'll need a few things:

1. A list of sources to pull from
2. A build script to build the sources
3. A list of artifacts to include in the package

In this example, we'll build the `go-md2man` package and container from [`go-md2man`](https://github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man) repo using `v2.0.3` tag in the repo.

First, let's start with the contructing a [Dalec spec](spec.md) file.

We define the metadata of the package in the spec. This includes the name, packager, vendor, license, website, and description of the package.

```yaml
# syntax=ghcr.io/azure/dalec/frontend:latest
name: go-md2man
version: 2.0.3
revision: "1"
license: MIT
description: A tool to convert markdown into man pages (roff).
packager: Dalec Example
vendor: Dalec Example
website: https://github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man
```

:::tip
In metadata section, `packager`, `vendor` and `website` are optional fields.
:::

In the next section, we define the sources that we will be pulling from. In this case, we are pulling from a git repository.

One thing to note, in many build systems you will not have access to the Internet while building the package, and indeed that is the case with the `mariner2` target. As such, this build will fail because `go build` will try to download the go modules. For this reason, we added a `generate` section to the source to run `go mod download` in a docker image with the `src` source mounted and then extract the go modules from the resulting filesystem.

```yaml
sources:
  src:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man.git
      commit: "v2.0.3"
    generate:
      - gomod: {}
```

In the next section, we define the dependencies that are needed to build the package. In this case, we need the `golang` dependency at the build time, and `openssl-libs` at runtime. Build dependencies are dependencies that are needed to build the package, while runtime dependencies are dependencies that are needed to run the package.

```yaml
dependencies:
  build:
    golang:
  runtime:
    openssl-libs:
```

:::note
Runtime dependencies are not required for this specific example, but they are included for illustrative purposes.
:::

Now, let's define the build steps. In this case, we are building the `go-md2man` binary.

```yaml
build:
  env:
    CGO_ENABLED: "0"
  steps:
    - command: |
        cd src
        go build -o go-md2man .
```

Next, we define the artifacts that we want to include in the package. In this case, we are including the `go-md2man` binary.

```yaml
artifacts:
  binaries:
    src/go-md2man:
```

Image section defines the entrypoint and command for the image. In this case, we are setting the entrypoint to `go-md2man` and the command to `--help`.

```yaml
image:
  entrypoint: go-md2man
  cmd: --help
```

Finally, we can add a test case to the spec file which helps ensure the package is assembled as expected. The following test will make sure `/usr/bin/go-md2man` is installed and has the expected permissions. These tests are automatically executed when building the container image.

```yaml
tests:
  - name: Check file permissions
    files:
      /usr/bin/go-md2man:
        permissions: 0755
```

Now, let's put it all together in a single file.

```yaml
# syntax=ghcr.io/azure/dalec/frontend:latest
name: go-md2man
version: 2.0.3
revision: "1"
packager: Dalec Example
vendor: Dalec Example
license: MIT
description: A tool to convert markdown into man pages (roff).
website: https://github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man

sources:
  src:
    generate:
      - gomod: {}
    git:
      url: https://github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man.git
      commit: "v2.0.3"

dependencies:
  build:
    golang:

build:
  env:
    CGO_ENABLED: "0"
  steps:
    - command: |
        cd src
        go build -o go-md2man .

artifacts:
  binaries:
    src/go-md2man:

image:
  entrypoint: go-md2man
  cmd: --help

tests:
  - name: Check bin
    files:
      /usr/bin/go-md2man:
        permissions: 0755
```

Now that we have a spec file, we can build the package and container using `docker`.

## Building using Docker

In this section, we'll go over how to build packages and containers with Dalec. Other applicable Docker commands (such as `--push` and others) will also apply to Dalec.

:::note
`mariner2` target here is an example. You can find more information about available targets in the [targets](targets.md) section.
:::

:::tip
These steps are independent of each other. You don't have to build an RPM first to build a container.
:::

### Building an RPM package

To build an RPM package only, we can use the following command:

```shell
docker build -t go-md2man:2.0.3 -f docs/examples/go-md2man.yml --target=mariner2/rpm --output=_output .
```

This will create `RPM` and `SRPM` directories in the `_output` directory with the built RPM and SRPM packages respectively.

### Building a container

To build a container, we can use the following command:

```shell
docker build -t go-md2man:2.0.3 -f docs/examples/go-md2man.yml --target=mariner2 .
```

This will produce a container image named `go-md2man:2.0.3`.
