# Container-only builds

It is possible to use Dalec when you wish to build a minimal image with only certain packages installed. To do this, simply define a Dalec spec with only runtime dependencies specified. The resulting image will contain only the specified packages and their dependencies.

```yaml
name: my-minimal-image
version: 0.1
description: A minimal image based on mariner2 with curl and shell access
revision: 1

targets:
    mariner2:
        image:
            base: mcr.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/distroless/minimal:2.0-nonroot

dependencies:
    runtime:
        curl:
        bash:

image:
    entrypoint: /bin/bash
```

How does this work? Dalec will create a [Virtual Package](virtual-packages.md) which has only the specified runtime dependencies, and install this in the target base image.
