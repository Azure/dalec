# Testing

Dalec supports adding tests to your spec file.
These tests are run against the container produced by your spec.
Dalec provides a few test helpers to make it easier to write tests when your image doesn't have the tools you need.

## Checks for files


### Check file existence

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /usr/bin/foo:
```

### Check file contents

Here are some examples on how to check the contents and metadata of a file in the output container.
You can use these to check that the files you expect are present and have the correct contents.


#### Check that a file contains some value:

Here we check that the content of the file `/etc/foo.conf` contains the string `foo=bar`.
You can specify multiple values to check for.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /etc/foo.conf:
                contains:
                    - foo=bar
```


#### Check that a file starts with some value:

Here we check that the content of the file `/etc/foo.conf` starts with the string `foo`.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /etc/foo.conf:
                starts_with: foo
```


#### Check that a file ends with some value:

Here we check that the content of the file `/etc/foo.conf` ends with the string `bar`.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /etc/foo.conf:
                ends_with: bar
```


#### Check that a file matches a regular expression:

Here we check that the content of the file `/etc/foo.conf` matches the regular expression `foo=.*`.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /etc/foo.conf:
                matches: "foo=.*"
```

#### Check that a file does not exist

Here we check that the file `/some/nonexistent/path` does not exist.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /some/nonexistent/path:
                not_exist: true
```

#### Check that a path is a directory

Here we check that the path `/some/path` is a directory.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /some/path:
                is_dir: true
```

#### Check file permissions

Here we check that the file `/etc/foo.conf` has the permissions `0644`.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /etc/foo.conf:
                permissions: 0644
```

#### Add multiple checks together

You can add multiple checks together to check multiple things about a file.
Note that some checks are mutually exclusive and will cause an error if you try to use them together.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        files:
            /etc/foo.conf:
                contains:
                    - foo=bar
                starts_with: foo
                ends_with: bar
                matches: "foo=.*"
                permissions: 0644
```


### Run a command

You can run a command in the container and check the stdout and/or stderr of that command.
These commands are run before any of the file checks are run and may influence the output of those checks.

Because these images often will not have a shell in them, if you want a shell you'll need to run it explicitly.


#### Capture stdio streams

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        steps:
            -
                command: echo "hello world"
                stdout:
                    equals:
                        - hello world\n
            -
                # Note: the image used for this test would need to have a shell in it for this to work
                command: /bin/sh -c 'echo "hello world" >&2'
                stderr:
                    equals:
                        - hello world\n
```

Pass in stdin to the command:

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        steps:
            -
                command: cat
                stdin: hello world
                stdout:
                    equals:
                        - hello world
```

#### Inject a file into the container for additional checks

Test cases support source mounts just like in the main spec.
You can use this to inject files, build helper binaries, or add whatever you need to run a test.

```yaml
name: My Package
# ... other spec fields

tests:
    -
        name: My Test case
        mounts:
            -
                dest: /target/mount/path
                spec:
                    build:
                        inline: |
                            FROM busybox
                            RUN echo hello > /hello

                            FROM scratch
                            COPY --from=busybox /hello /hello
        steps:
            -
                command: cat /path/in/container
                stdout:
                    equals: hello

```
