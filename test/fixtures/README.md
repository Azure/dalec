# Test Fixtures

These are test fixtures for integration testing.  They are not intended to be
consumed by anyone.  You may find them useful for figuring out how a feature
works (or digging into what features exist). There may even be some
real-world-ish examples that you could base your own spec file on, just remember
these are specifically here for testing scenarios.
